    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat:</li>
        <p>his lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</p>
        <li>Onion:</li>
        <p>A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</p>
        <li>Canned tomatoes:</li>
        <p>You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</p>
        <li>Fresh herbs:</li>
        <p>For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</p>
        <li>Sugar:</li>
        <p>A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</p>
        <li>Spices and seasonings:</li>
        <p>This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</p>
        <li>Noodles:</li>
        <p>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, 
            but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</p>
        <li>Cheese:</li>
        <p>The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</p>
        <li>Eggs:</li>
        <p>Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent 
            (which means they hold the layer together). </p>
    </ul>
    <br>
